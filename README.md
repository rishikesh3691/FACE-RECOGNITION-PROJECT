# Face Recognition System

This project is a web-based Face Recognition System developed using Python, Flask, OpenCV, and SQLite. The application allows users to register, log in securely, upload images, and automatically detect the number of faces present in the uploaded image.

The system uses OpenCV’s Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection and stores user information and detection results in a SQLite database. The web interface is built using HTML and CSS to provide a simple and user-friendly experience.

## Features

- User Registration and Login
- Secure Session Management
- Image Upload Functionality
- Face Detection using OpenCV
- SQLite Database Integration
- Result Display with Face Count
- Simple and Responsive Web Interface

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Flask  
- OpenCV  
- SQLite  
- HTML / CSS  

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the application:

python app.py

3. Open browser:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a simple yet effective face detection system that demonstrates the integration of computer vision with web development. The system serves as a foundation for advanced face recognition applications.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time webcam face detection  
- Deep learning-based face recognition  
- Password encryption
